# 1993FD
Using the Principles of Virology to match biology and artificial life for the computer scientist in studies of a cure like the Influenza virus.

# Behavior

Without the language like math, it is useless to do this work. Biology to Synthetic Biology may be easy. Synthetic Biology to Artificial Life will require an inaccurate set of rules that generate two languages for the behavior (SB to AL) and definition (B and SB) on any virus.

B -> SB -> AL -> SB -> B

# Compliant
## Keeping a body

* steal - closed hardware (only open hardware is Dell, ...only super dupter, computing biology, not destructive, completely intuitive system is HP)
* spy - spy([bloat]soft)ware
* (GET) rape - virus, worm, tro-jan
* forget -  police (people), military (government), ...oh so stupid
* repeat - mal(soft)ware
